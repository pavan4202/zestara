### project name

Development of video on demand website based on django

### Background of the project

After learning python and django, I wanted to find a hands-on project. I originally wanted to write a blog project to practice hands-on, but others have already written about it, so I plan to write a video-on-demand website because I like watching videos very much, especially YouTube and bilibili. They are all video websites that I like very much, so I want to implement a simple video-on-demand website by myself and apply what I have learned.
